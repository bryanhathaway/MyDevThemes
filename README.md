# Metallic - Xcode Theme

My Xcode theme that I like, put here for safekeeping. Boosts productivity by 300%.

Uses mostly similar colours as the default theme, just adjusted for a dark (but not black) background.

# Glass - Terminal Theme

Because terminal kept getting in the way of me appreciating my wallpapers. Hard to read sometimes, depending on the wallpaper, but worth it.
